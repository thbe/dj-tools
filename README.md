# dj-tools

Scripts and Tools that help me organize my DJ workflow.

## Requirements

Most of the scripts are Python based, so you need a working Python 3 environment as well as the modules defined in the import section.

## DJ.Studio

* **show_id3.tags.py** - Script to show the ID3 tags of mp3 files in a given directory
* **update_id3_tags.py** - Script to add missing ID3 tags after exporting from DJ.Studio to pre-listen the mix in Apple Music
